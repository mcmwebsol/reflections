What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates a ".git" directory in the current working directory.  This is needed so git knows what to do.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a separate version of the file(s) that is not in the repository yet.
It offers a temporary area to avoid committing to the repository when in the middle of changes.
